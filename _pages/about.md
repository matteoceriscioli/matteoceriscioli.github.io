I am a **PhD student in Artificial Intelligence** at *Oregon State University*, working at the intersection of causality and AI. My objective is to develop robust and reliable AI systems that understand the world, are able to adapt to changes, and operate safely.

> *"Robust AI doesn't just adapt to change, it learns the rules behind it."*

## Research Interests
- **Causal Inference & Discovery** – Developing algorithms for causal reasoning.
- **Multi-Agent Systems** – Designing techniques to verify agents' understanding of their environment.
- **AI Safety** – Ensuring AI makes safe and reliable decisions.

## Publications

- **Causal Discovery with Adaptable AI Agents** - *AAAI-25 W33: Artificial Intelligence with Causal Techniques*

<!--### Ongoing Work
- **A Causal Framework for AI Safety** - *In preparation for UAI-25*
- **On the Efficacy of Discrete Curvature in Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks** - *In preparation*

### Peer-reviewed papers-->

<!-- - **Causal Discovery via Adaptive Agents in Multi-Agent and Sequential Decision Tasks** - *AAMAS-25 Adaptive Agents Workshop* -->
