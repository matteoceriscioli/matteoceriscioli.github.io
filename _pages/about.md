I am a **PhD student in Artificial Intelligence** at *Oregon State University*, working at the intersection of causality and AI under the supervision of Prof. [Karthika Mohan](https://karthikamohan.com/). My objective is to develop the foundations for robust and reliable AI systems that understand the world, are able to adapt to changes, and operate safely.

> *"Robust AI doesn't just react to change, it learns the rules behind it."*

## Research Interests
- **Causal Inference & Discovery** – Developing algorithms for causal reasoning.
- **Multi-Agent Systems** – Designing techniques to verify agents' understanding of their environment.
- **AI Safety** – Ensuring AI makes safe and reliable decisions.

## Publications
