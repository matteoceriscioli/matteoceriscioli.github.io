I am a **PhD student in Artificial Intelligence** at *Oregon State University*, working at the intersection of causality and AI under the supervision of Prof. [Karthika Mohan](https://karthikamohan.com/). My objective is to develop the foundations for robust and reliable AI systems that understand the world, are able to adapt to changes, and operate safely.

> *"Robust AI doesn't just react to change, it learns the rules behind it."*

Earlier, I was a Research Trainee at *RIKEN AIP* in Japan, where I worked in the [Causal Inference team](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/cause_infer/index.html) led by Prof. [Shohei Shimizu](https://sites.google.com/view/sshimizu06/lab?authuser=0). I also interned at *Vodafone Germany* in the Deep Insights Consumer Data Science team, under the supervision of Dr. [Rolf Bardeli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolf-bardeli-30689a2/?originalSubdomain=de), where I developed causal reasoning tools and designed GNN models for community detection tasks as part of my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the *Heinrich-Heine University of Düsseldorf*, with Prof. [Paul Swoboda](https://www.sarmata.hhu.de/) as my thesis supervisor. Before that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at the *University of Trento*, Italy, where I wrote a thesis on Hopfield networks under the supervision of Prof. [Alberto Montresor](https://cricca.disi.unitn.it/montresor/).

## Research Interests
- **Causal Inference & Discovery** – Developing algorithms for causal reasoning.
- **Multi-Agent Systems** – Designing techniques to verify agents' understanding of their environment.
- **AI Safety** – Ensuring AI makes safe and reliable decisions.

## Reviewing
Reviewer for **Behaviormetrika**, an international peer-reviewed journal of the Behaviormetric Society of Japan, publishing research in data science and statistical modeling.
